# N-grams practice 

N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items (words, characters, or symbols) in a given text or speech. The "n" in n-grams represents the number of items in each sequence. For example:

    - Unigrams (1-grams): Each word is considered as a separate unit.
        Example: "The quick brown fox" would have unigrams like ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"].

    - Bigrams (2-grams): Sequences of two adjacent words.
        Example: "The quick brown fox" would have bigrams like ["The quick", "quick brown", "brown fox"].

    - Trigrams (3-grams): Sequences of three adjacent words.
        Example: "The quick brown fox" would have trigrams like ["The quick brown", "quick brown fox"].
